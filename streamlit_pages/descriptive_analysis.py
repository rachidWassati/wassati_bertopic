    Welcome to the Descriptive Analysis section of the dashboard. This section is designed to provide a detailed overview of the data, focusing on the distribution of scores and comments across different geographical areas and time periods.

    Here, you'll find visualizations such as:

    1. **Score Distribution by Class**: These charts show how product scores and recommendation scores are distributed across different classes (year, zone, clusters, etc.). They can help us understand how performance varies across different areas or periods.

    2. **Comment Fulfillment Rate by Class**: These charts show the rate of comment fulfillment for each class. They can help us understand where we're getting the most feedback and where there might be gaps.

    3. **Count Frequency Bar Charts**: These charts show the total number of comments for each topic, year, zone, etc. They give an idea of where most of the feedback is coming from.

    Remember, these charts represent raw counts, so they might be influenced by the size of each class. In the next section, we'll look at percentage-based charts that put everything on an equal footing for easier comparison.

    Feel free to explore these visualizations and gain insights into your data. If you have any questions or need further clarification on any chart, don't hesitate to ask.
